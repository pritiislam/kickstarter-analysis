# Kickstarting with Excel

## Overview of Project

### Purpose
Analyze campaign outcomes and assess how they fared based on their launch dates and their funding goals. 

## Analysis and Challenges

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date
This part of the challenge was easy to navigate through. It took a little bit of trial and error to get the YEAR function to work. I made the simple mistake of typing in "years" instead of "year". Creating the pivot table and chart were straight forward. I hneeded help depicting the graph in terms of months, so I utilized google to learn how to group row labels. 

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals
This section was a bit more challenging. I had to break down the logic behind the COUNTIF statements. Once that was done, it was time consuming to find the best way to copy and paste the formula to apply to the rest of the table, but it was not that bad. Creating the pivot chart was challenging as well. I had to figure out how to rearrange the row labels and how to reflect percentages for the y axis. 

### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered

## Results

- What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?
It is clear that theater productions launched in May/ Jun performed better than any other time during the year. It also seems like October is not ideal to launch a new production as there is a spike in failed outcomes and there is also a steady decline in success rate.

- What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?
We can see that the majority of projects fall within the the goal amount of 20000 or less. We can also see that these projects have a higher success rate. As the goal amount increases, the number of projects and the success rate both start to decrease. 

- What are some limitations of this dataset?
This data shows goals, pledges and backers, but it does not show data pertaining how backers were acquired, how funds were spent, if funds helped the projects become profitable, and if there are any kickstarter fees that may affect the total amount. 


- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?
There are so many ways to visualize data! We practiced the stacked bar graphs in the Module and I think that could be helpful in easily seeing who met their goal and with how many backers vs who did not meet their goal. Any statistical chart will give us another perspective on the data. A scatter plot would also help us easily visualize which projects fall into different categories ie. success rate, goal, pledge, etc.
